Opening front camera directly is a challenging task to me because i have never used it before.
I cannot able to figure it out that how to take two images in one second, Now i can take only one image for 2 seconds. This is a huge challenge to me.
Stored the images in a secure way such that the images are not accessible to attackers. Stored in /data/data/com.example.krishnatejaare.frontcam/app_imageDir/profile.jpg/Image-dateandtime.jpg
